/**
 * Lightweight in-memory cache mapping (ServerLevel, BlockPos) → (grownSince tick, quality).
 *
 * ── Why this instead of a BlockEntity? ───────────────────────────────────
 * CropBlock has no BlockEntity. Adding one would require touching the block
 * class heavily and registering a new BE type. This cache stores the data
 * for fully-grown crops in memory — zero disk/NBT overhead.
 *
 * ── Persistence across chunk unload ──────────────────────────────────────
 * The cache is NOT persisted. If a chunk unloads and reloads before the crop
 * is harvested, the crop appears fully grown but has no age data in cache —
 * harvest drops will have ageTicks = 0 (treated as Young, quality re-rolled
 * is Basic as fallback). This is an acceptable tradeoff: the player only loses
 * the age bonus if they unload the chunk, not the crop itself.
 *
 * Alternative persistent approach (not used here):
 *   Store grownSince as a BlockEntity long. More robust but more overhead.
 *   Implement later if persistence becomes required.
 *
 * ── Cleanup ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WeakHashMap on the outer level means ServerLevel instances that are no
 * longer referenced (e.g. after world unload) are garbage collected along
 * with their data automatically.
